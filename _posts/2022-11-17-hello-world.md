I always wanted to have a personal blog. For sharing cool personal projects that I work on but also to have a place where I can drop ideas and discoveries at one place.
There are a bunch of viable blogging solutions out there. Describing all of them would be beyond the scope of this post.

I tried some of them and ended up using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
This "simple, blog-aware, static sites" generator perfectly fits my needs.

## Requirements

fast, easy to setup and maintain, looks good (enough), battery-included (no seo setup etc. - should just work)
