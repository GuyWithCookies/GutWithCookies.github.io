Do you know this feeling? You start a long overnight print on your precious Ultimaker 3.
The next day you excitely come back to your printer just to find out that the filament ran out in the middle of the print[^1].
Of course, one could just do a proper estimate and check if the filament is enought but aint' gonna have time for that!

Instead I invested some[^2] hours into developing a automated sensor to check if filament runs low and if so - the printer will be stopped. Can't be too hard, can it?

[^1]: Given the price tag on that printer I would have expected that functionality to be build in - but I guess I should just stop expecting things...
[^2]: way too much
